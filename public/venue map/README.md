# Venue maps

All venue map SVGs live in this folder. Each map is used for a specific venue and event type.

## Current maps

| File | Venue | Event type | Notes |
|------|--------|------------|--------|
| `venue-map-msg.svg` | Madison Square Garden | Concert | Used for MSG (v1) – sections 101–306, floor, stage |
| `crypto-arena.svg` | Crypto.com Arena | Basketball (sports) | Used for basketball/sports at Crypto.com Arena (v2). Section paths: Court, Lower Bowl, Upper Bowl. Colors indicate availability. |

When you add new SVGs, use a clear naming pattern and update the app to load the correct map per event type/venue.
